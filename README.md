# What is a Helm Chart?

## Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is a helpful tool for cloud-native developers.
- It has limitations and cannot solve everything on its own.

## Open Source Projects
- Open source projects complement Kubernetes by filling its gaps.
- These tools enhance functionality by combining with Kubernetes.
- Example: Helm.

## What is Helm?
- Helm is known as "the package manager for Kubernetes" but does more than just package management.
- It is an open-source project created by DeisLabs and now maintained by CNCF.
## Purpose of Helm
- Simplifies management of Kubernetes YAML files.
- Introduces Helm Charts:
  - Bundles with one or more Kubernetes manifests.
  - Can include child and dependent charts.

## Features of Helm Charts
  - Installs the entire dependency tree of a project with a single command.
  - Versions manifest files, similar to Node.js packages.
  - Allows installation of specific chart versions.
  - Maintains a release history of deployed charts for rollback capabilities.

## Benefits of Helm
  - Native support for Kubernetes.
  - Simplifies usage by allowing templates to be added to charts without complex syntax.
  - Reduces the need for manual manifest management with `kubectl`.

## Why Use Helm?
  - Simplifies application manifest management.
  - Automates deployments and configuration versioning.
